# Two Sum - Brute Force Solution (Java)

This repository mainly contains my C language solutions, but this is a Java implementation of the Two Sum problem using a brute force approach.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
Each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.

## Approach

- **Brute Force:** Iterate through every pair `(i, j)` in the array to check if their sum equals the target.  
- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)  
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Future Improvements

I am currently working on learning HashMaps and will update this solution soon with an optimized approach to improve the runtime to O(n).
